### Description

* Love modern C++ and SQL. 1000 lines of template metaprogramming >> a single line of duplicate code
* I also like blender, NumPy, Unreal Engine 4, nginx
* This isn't a CV/resume, these are hobby projects. They aim for maximum abstraction and runtime performance for purely aesthetic reasons.

I also write poetry. Actually I don't, but that can be our little secret.
